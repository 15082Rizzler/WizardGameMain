VERY IMPORTANT - READ BELOW

I've got a plugin installed in this version of the game that could be helpful for further multiplayer refinement if we have time for it down the line.
I have not used it in the code yet, but I'd recomend downloading the plugin so you don't have any issues loading up the project should you decide to
do so.

I've got both advanced sessions and steam advanced sessions installed in the project. When you unzip the file containing the plugins, open up your file
browser and navigate to the 5.4 version of UE5 (the file path should look like this: C:\Program Files\Epic Games\UE_5.4\Engine\Plugins) or download
it if you haven't already, and drop the folders contained within the zip ("AdvancedSessions" and "SteamAdvancedSessions") into the plugins file

here's the link to the plugin zip file
